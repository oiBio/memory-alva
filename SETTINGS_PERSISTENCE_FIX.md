# Settings Persistence Fix - Alvas Memory Game

## Problem Description
The user reported that game settings (difficulty level, artifacts checkbox, and number of players) were not being persistent when starting a new game.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Missing Real-time Save**: Settings were only saved when starting a game, not when users changed them
2. **Reset Override**: The `resetGame()` method was hard-resetting all form elements to defaults, overriding saved settings
3. **Missing Event Listeners**: No listeners for immediate settings persistence on user interactions

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Event Listeners (`js/memory-game.js`)
- Added event listeners for real-time settings saving on all user interactions:
  - Game mode buttons (Single/Multiplayer)
  - Difficulty buttons (Easy/Medium/Hard/Expert)
  - Artifacts checkbox (Show original icons vs üéÅ)
  - Player name inputs

### 2. New Helper Method (`js/memory-game.js`)
```javascript
saveCurrentSettings() {
    // Immediately saves current form state to localStorage
    // Called whenever user changes any setting
}
```

### 3. Fixed Reset Behavior (`js/memory-game.js`)
- Changed `resetGame()` to load saved settings instead of resetting to defaults
- Only clears game state (score, cards, etc.), preserves user preferences

### 4. Enhanced Settings Loading (`js/game-persistence.js`)
- Added default fallback values when no settings are saved
- Ensures consistent behavior for new users

## Testing the Fix

### Test Case 1: Settings Persistence
1. Open the game in browser (http://localhost:8042)
2. Change settings:
   - Switch to "Einzelspieler" (Single Player)
   - Change difficulty to "Schwer" (Hard - 36 cards)
   - Check "‚ú® Fundst√ºcke als Original-Icons zeigen"
   - Change player name to something custom
3. Start and play a game
4. Click "üè† Neues Spiel" (New Game)
5. **Expected Result**: All settings should be preserved exactly as you set them

### Test Case 2: Real-time Saving
1. Open the game
2. Change any setting (difficulty, game mode, checkbox)
3. Refresh the page (F5)
4. **Expected Result**: Settings should be preserved even after page refresh

### Test Case 3: Cross-session Persistence
1. Set custom settings
2. Close browser completely
3. Reopen browser and navigate to the game
4. **Expected Result**: Your settings should still be there

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
- `js/memory-game.js`: Enhanced event listeners, added settings helper, fixed reset behavior
- `js/game-persistence.js`: Improved settings loading with defaults

### localStorage Keys Used:
- `memoryGameSettings`: Stores user preferences (persistent across sessions)
- `memoryGameState`: Stores active game state (cleared on new game)

### Event-driven Architecture:
- Settings are saved immediately when user interacts with any control
- No user action is lost, even if they accidentally refresh the page
- Game state and user preferences are kept separate

## Browser Compatibility
- Works with all modern browsers that support localStorage
- Gracefully handles cases where localStorage is not available
- No external dependencies required

## Performance Impact
- Minimal overhead: Only saves small JSON objects to localStorage
- No network requests involved
- Immediate response to user interactions
