# Alvas Fantastisches Fundstück-Memory - Refactored Structure

This is the refactored version of the Memory game with a modular file structure for better maintainability and organization.

## Project Overview

This project has been refactored from a monolithic structure into a clean, modular architecture for better maintainability, readability, and extensibility.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Modular CSS Architecture
- **Before**: Single `styles.css` file with 1000+ lines
- **After**: 5 focused CSS modules:
  - `css/base.css` - CSS variables, base styles, accessibility
  - `css/components.css` - Component styles (cards, buttons, forms)  
  - `css/layout.css` - Layout containers and structural elements
  - `css/animations.css` - All animations and transitions
  - `css/responsive.css` - Responsive design rules

### 2. Modular JavaScript Architecture  
- **Before**: Single `game.js` file with 900+ lines
- **After**: 6 focused JavaScript modules:
  - `js/config.js` - Game and confetti configuration constants
  - `js/confetti.js` - Complete Confetti class for celebration effects
  - `js/game-data.js` - All game data including image variants
  - `js/game-persistence.js` - Save/load functionality for game state and settings
  - `js/memory-game.js` - Main MemoryGame class with all game logic
  - `js/app.js` - Application initialization

### 3. Settings Persistence Bug Fix ✅
- **Issue**: Game settings (difficulty level, artifacts checkbox, number of players) were not being persisted when starting a new game
- **Root Causes**:
  - Settings only saved on game start, not on user interaction
  - Reset game method overrode saved settings with defaults
  - Missing event listeners for real-time persistence
- **Solution**: 
  - Added immediate settings save on all user interactions
  - Fixed reset behavior to preserve user preferences
  - Enhanced GamePersistence class with better defaults
- **Result**: All user settings now persist across games and browser sessions

### 4. Updated HTML Structure
- Modified `index.html` to load modular CSS and JavaScript files
- Maintained proper dependency loading order
- No functional changes to game features

```

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Better Organization**: Related code is grouped together in logical modules
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to specific features are isolated to relevant files
3. **Improved Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules simultaneously
4. **Better Performance**: Smaller files can be cached more efficiently
5. **Clearer Dependencies**: File imports show clear relationships between modules

## Loading Order

The files are loaded in the following order in `index.html`:

1. CSS files (base → components → layout → animations → responsive)
2. JavaScript configuration and data files
3. External dependencies (sounds, ui)
4. Main game logic and initialization

## Game Functionality

All game functionality remains exactly the same. The refactoring only reorganizes the code structure without changing any game mechanics or features.

## Migration Notes

- The original `styles.css` and `game.js` files can be safely removed after confirming the refactored version works correctly
- All game features, settings, and save/load functionality are preserved
- No changes to game rules, scoring, or user interface behavior
